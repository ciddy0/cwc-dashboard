# Club World Cuup 2025 Soccer Stats Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit-powered dashboard showcasing match and tournament statistics for the club World Cup 2025.

## Overview

This repository contains the front-end application for viewing soccer statistics. The data backing the dashboard is ingested via a seperate Data Pipeline from the ESPN API, transformed, and loaded into a Supabase PostgreSQL database
